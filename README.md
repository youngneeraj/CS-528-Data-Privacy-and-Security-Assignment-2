Tasks:

(a) Derive the global sensitivity for the query (average age). 

Solution: For the average age query on the dataset, the global sensitivity (GSf) will be Maximum change in 
average age, when a single individual’s record is added or removed. Mathematically, it will be 

∆ f = Max Age – Min Age / n 

Where,

➢ n = Total number of Individual’s with age greater than 25.

➢ Max Age = 90 

How did we get to know that Maximum Age is 90? 

Maximum Age:
